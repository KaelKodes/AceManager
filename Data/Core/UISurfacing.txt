WWI Pilot RPG — UISurfacing.txt
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Defines how information is shown to the player and how complex systems remain readable and fair.

============================================================
1) CORE UI PHILOSOPHY
============================================================

The UI must:
- Inform without overwhelming
- Explain outcomes without exposing raw math
- Make the player feel responsible, not confused
- Preserve uncertainty where appropriate

The UI is not a dashboard of numbers.
It is a command interface.

============================================================
2) INFORMATION TIERS
============================================================

All information is divided into three tiers.

------------------------------------------------------------
TIER 1 — ALWAYS VISIBLE
------------------------------------------------------------

Shown every day without player action.

Includes:
- Current date and location
- Weather
- Base summary (ratings I–V)
- Aircraft availability
- Pilot readiness
- Active shortages or bottlenecks

This answers:
“Can we operate today?”

------------------------------------------------------------
TIER 2 — CONTEXTUAL DETAILS
------------------------------------------------------------

Shown when the player clicks or hovers.

Includes:
- Why a base rating is limited
- Why a resource is low
- Why a mission is unavailable
- Why a pilot is grounded or fatigued
- Why command expectations changed

This answers:
“Why is this happening?”

------------------------------------------------------------
TIER 3 — POST-EVENT EXPLANATION
------------------------------------------------------------

Shown after missions and events.

Includes:
- What influenced success or failure
- Which pilots or aircraft mattered
- Which base ratings helped or hurt
- Strategic consequences
- Command reaction

This answers:
“What did my decisions cause?”

============================================================
3) BASE UI PRESENTATION
============================================================

The base is presented as a STATUS PANEL, not a map.

Displayed:
- Base type (Grass Strip / Forward Base / Regional Hub)
- Progress level (Roman numerals)
- Base ratings (A–I) shown as bars or icons
- Warnings for overstress or shortages

Exact numbers are hidden.
Relative strength and direction are clear.

============================================================
4) MISSION PLANNING UI
============================================================

Mission planning is presented as a single, focused screen.

The player selects:
- Mission type
- Target / distance
- Aircraft and pilots
- Risk posture

The UI clearly displays:
- Expected duration
- Relative risk (Low / Medium / High)
- Resource strain (icons, not numbers)
- Fatigue impact

The UI NEVER promises outcomes.
It communicates likelihood and risk.

============================================================
5) MISSION RESULTS UI
============================================================

After a mission, the player sees:

- Result band (Success, Failure, etc.)
- Aircraft losses or damage
- Pilot status changes
- Strategic impact summary
- Notable moments (kills, saves, mistakes)

Highlighted callouts explain:
- Which skills triggered
- Which ratings mattered
- Where luck intervened

============================================================
6) NATIONAL AI FEEDBACK
============================================================

The Nation is communicated indirectly.

Methods:
- Command messages
- Allocation changes
- Mission availability
- Officer commentary
- News reports

The UI never shows:
- Approval scores
- Hidden reputation meters
- AI priorities directly

The player infers the Nation’s mood through consequences.

============================================================
7) STRATEGIC MAP UI
============================================================

The strategic map is optional and abstracted.

Shown:
- Airbases
- Supply nodes
- Major routes
- Disrupted connections
- Frontline shifts

Not shown:
- Exact throughput values
- Enemy plans
- Hidden AI calculations

The map explains WHY logistics change, not HOW MUCH.

============================================================
8) NARRATIVE & EVENTS UI
============================================================

Narrative content appears as:
- Briefings
- Bulletins
- Letters
- Conversations
- After-action summaries

Major events are clearly flagged.
Historical names are highlighted respectfully.

The UI never says:
“You changed history.”

It shows:
“This event unfolded differently.”

============================================================
9) FAILURE & FAIRNESS
============================================================

When something goes wrong, the UI must always show:

- At least one clear contributing factor
- Whether the failure was due to:
  - Logistics
  - Fatigue
  - Planning
  - Risk
  - Enemy strength
  - Weather

Randomness is acknowledged, never hidden.

============================================================
10) PLAYER TRUST GOAL
============================================================

The player should always feel:

- Informed enough to make decisions
- Surprised, but not cheated
- Responsible for outcomes
- Confident that preparation matters

If the player loses, they should understand why.

============================================================
11) DESIGN GOAL
============================================================

A player who understands the UI
should be able to explain the game to someone else
without referencing formulas or hidden systems.

The UI teaches the game by existing.
