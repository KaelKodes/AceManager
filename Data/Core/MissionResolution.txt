WWI Pilot RPG — MissionResolutionLogic.txt
Version: 1.0
Status: CORE SIMULATION LOCKED
Purpose: Defines how missions are resolved using pilots, aircraft, base ratings, and context.

============================================================
1) DESIGN GOAL
============================================================

Mission resolution must:
- Be understandable to the player
- Reward good preparation
- Punish overreach
- Produce believable WWI outcomes
- Generate stories, not just numbers

No single factor determines success.
Outcomes emerge from combined pressure.

============================================================
2) MISSION RESOLUTION OVERVIEW
============================================================

Each mission resolves in FOUR PHASES:

1) Readiness Check
2) Contact & Engagement
3) Outcome Determination
4) Consequences & Feedback

Each phase can modify or limit the next.

============================================================
3) PHASE 1 — READINESS CHECK
============================================================

Before combat, the game evaluates whether the mission
launches as planned.

Factors checked:

- Aircraft availability
- Pilot fatigue
- Fuel availability
- Weather
- Runway rating
- Maintenance rating

Possible results:
- Full launch
- Reduced launch (fewer aircraft)
- Delayed launch
- Mission aborted

Failures here are logistical, not combat-related.

============================================================
4) PHASE 2 — CONTACT & ENGAGEMENT
============================================================

Determines IF and HOW the mission encounters the enemy.

Factors:
- Mission type
- Distance
- Enemy activity level
- Operations rating
- Pilot Offensive Awareness
- Pilot Defensive Awareness
- Weather

Possible results:
- No contact
- Limited contact
- Full engagement
- Ambush (rare, dangerous)

This phase determines combat intensity.

============================================================
5) PHASE 3 — OUTCOME DETERMINATION
============================================================

Outcome is resolved using combined strength comparisons.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) FRIENDLY EFFECTIVENESS SCORE
------------------------------------------------------------

Calculated from:
- Aircraft combat stats
- Pilot derived ratings (Dogfight, Escort, Recon, etc.)
- Pilot skills (Ace, Wingman, Overwatch, etc.)
- Formation cohesion
- Risk posture
- Operations rating
- Training rating

------------------------------------------------------------
B) ENEMY EFFECTIVENESS SCORE
------------------------------------------------------------

Calculated from:
- Known or estimated enemy strength
- Enemy air presence
- Mission location
- Time period
- Surprise factors

------------------------------------------------------------
C) RESULT BAND
------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing both sides produces a result band:

- Decisive Success
- Success
- Marginal Success
- Stalemate
- Marginal Failure
- Failure
- Disaster

The band determines rewards and losses.

============================================================
6) PHASE 4 — CONSEQUENCES
============================================================

Based on the result band, the following are resolved:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) LOSSES
------------------------------------------------------------

- Aircraft damaged or destroyed
- Pilots wounded, killed, or missing
- Fatigue accumulation

Medical and Maintenance ratings modify survival and recovery.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) RESOURCE IMPACT
------------------------------------------------------------

- Fuel consumed
- Ammunition consumed
- Maintenance wear applied
- Spare part strain added

------------------------------------------------------------
C) PILOT DEVELOPMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

Pilots may:
- Gain experience
- Improve stats
- Acquire or reinforce skills
- Suffer confidence loss if failures stack

Training rating strongly affects this.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) STRATEGIC EFFECT
------------------------------------------------------------

Mission contributes to:
- Air superiority
- Ground operations
- Supply line safety
- Intelligence quality

Effects accumulate over days, not instantly.

============================================================
7) ROLE OF KEY SKILLS
============================================================

Key skills modify specific moments:

- Ace: increases kill and survival chance in engagements
- Wingman: increases assist and save chance for paired allies
- Overseer: reduces surprise and ambush risk for squad
- Pack Hunter: increases effectiveness in multi-aircraft attacks
- Lone Wolf: boosts solo actions, reduces cohesion
- Steady: reduces performance loss under stress
- Hotspur: increases engagement frequency and risk
- Flight Leader: increases cohesion and reduces errors
- Instructor: boosts post-mission improvement
- Survivor: increases disengagement success

Skills never guarantee outcomes — they tilt probability.

============================================================
8) FAILURE IS NOT ALWAYS BAD
============================================================

Even failed missions can:
- Gain intelligence
- Train pilots
- Build reputation for effort
- Delay enemy action

Command values persistence, not perfection.

============================================================
9) PLAYER FEEDBACK
============================================================

After each mission, the player is shown:

- What went right
- What went wrong
- Which factors mattered
- How base ratings influenced results
- How command reacted

No opaque results.
No unexplained losses.

============================================================
10) DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
============================================================

The player should learn naturally:

- When to push
- When to rest
- When logistics matter more than bravery
- When one more mission is too many

The war is not won in a day.
Neither is a squadron.
