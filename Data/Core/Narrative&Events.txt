WWI Pilot RPG — NarrativeAndEvents.txt
Version: 1.0
Status: NARRATIVE SYSTEM LOCKED
Purpose: Defines how historical events, aces, and major missions exist alongside player agency.

============================================================
1) CORE NARRATIVE PHILOSOPHY
============================================================

The game follows REAL HISTORY by default.

- Major historical events WILL occur.
- Famous aces WILL exist.
- Large-scale operations WILL be attempted.

However:
- The player can influence outcomes.
- History can bend, but it does not break without cause.
- Divergence requires action, not passive presence.

The game answers the question:
"What happens if YOU were really there?"

============================================================
2) EVENT CATEGORIES
============================================================

All narrative content is categorized.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) MAJOR HISTORICAL EVENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:
- Verdun air battles
- The Somme air offensive
- Bloody April
- Cambrai
- Spring Offensives of 1918

Properties:
- Fixed dates (historical window)
- Fixed strategic intent
- Variable outcomes

These events WILL attempt to trigger
unless they are rendered impossible by prior changes.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) HISTORICAL ACES
------------------------------------------------------------

Examples:
- Manfred von Richthofen
- René Fonck
- Edward Mannock
- Billy Bishop
- Georges Guynemer

Properties:
- Enter the war at historical dates
- Assigned to historically accurate units and regions
- Possess elite stats and appropriate skills

By default:
- They perform close to historical record
- They die or survive historically

Player intervention can:
- Kill them earlier
- Save them
- Change their effectiveness
- Alter their legacy

============================================================
3) EVENT TRIGGERS
============================================================

Events are triggered by one or more of:

- Date window
- Geographic location
- Strategic conditions
- Frontline status
- Air superiority levels

Events DO NOT trigger if:
- The required region is lost
- The opposing force has been neutralized
- The objective has already been achieved or made irrelevant

============================================================
4) PLAYER INTERACTION WITH EVENTS
============================================================

The player may interact with events in several ways:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) DIRECT PARTICIPATION
------------------------------------------------------------

- Assigned to support a historical operation
- Asked to escort, recon, or intercept
- Given optional objectives tied to real history

------------------------------------------------------------
B) INDIRECT INFLUENCE
------------------------------------------------------------

- Weakening enemy air presence beforehand
- Protecting or disrupting logistics
- Training elite pilots who replace historical figures

------------------------------------------------------------
C) NON-INTERVENTION
------------------------------------------------------------

If the player does nothing:
- History proceeds normally
- Outcomes match recorded history within variance

============================================================
5) EVENT OUTCOMES
============================================================

Each event has outcome bands:

- Historical Outcome (default)
- Improved Outcome
- Reduced Outcome
- Failed Outcome
- Alternate Outcome (rare)

Outcomes affect:
- National morale
- Strategic pressure
- Resource allocation
- Narrative reputation

============================================================
6) HISTORICAL ACES — BEHAVIOR RULES
============================================================

Historical aces are NOT scripted heroes.

They:
- Fly missions
- Take risks
- Can be wounded or killed
- Can be grounded
- Can be outperformed

However:
- They are protected from random, meaningless death
- They die only in combat-related or event-driven situations
- Their deaths are ALWAYS acknowledged narratively

============================================================
7) PLAYER-DRIVEN DIVERGENCE
============================================================

Divergence occurs when the player:

- Kills a historical ace
- Prevents a key mission
- Achieves air superiority earlier than history
- Protects critical infrastructure unusually well

When divergence occurs:
- Future events adapt
- Replacement figures emerge
- Command doctrine may shift
- History bends plausibly, not fantastically

============================================================
8) EVENT MEMORY & CONSEQUENCES
============================================================

The game remembers:

- Who lived
- Who died
- Which missions succeeded
- Which events were altered

These memories influence:
- Dialogue
- Command tone
- News reports
- Pilot reputation
- Late-war narrative flavor

============================================================
9) PRESENTATION TO THE PLAYER
============================================================

Events are presented through:
- Briefings
- News bulletins
- Officer conversations
- Letters
- After-action reports

The game never says:
"You changed history."

It shows:
"History reacted."

============================================================
10) FAILURE IS PART OF THE STORY
============================================================

Historical disasters can still occur.

The player is not expected to:
- Win every battle
- Save every ace
- Prevent every loss

Failure generates:
- Pressure
- Narrative weight
- Strategic consequences
- Emotional investment

============================================================
11) DESIGN GOAL
============================================================

The player should feel:

- Small, but important
- In history, not above it
- Responsible, but not omnipotent
- Remembered, even if forgotten by textbooks

History is the stage.
The player is a force upon it.
