WWI STRATEGIC INDUSTRY & TARGET SYSTEM
-------------------------------------

This document defines a shared set of industrial, logistical, and military
infrastructure nodes present on all sides during WWI. These structures are
not owned by the player, but directly affect airfield operations, mission
availability, supply flow, and strategic pressure.

The player’s airfield is one node within this larger war economy.

==================================================
1. INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION TARGETS
(Rear-area, high-value, limited redundancy)
==================================================

1.1 Munitions Works
- Produces artillery shells, bombs, and small-arms ammunition
- Strategic Importance:
  - Enables sustained ground offensives
  - Directly impacts artillery and bombing availability
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Reduced shell supply
  - Slower offensive tempo
  - Increased enemy shortages

----------------------------------

1.2 Steel & Metal Works
- Produces gun barrels, aircraft frames, vehicles, and rail material
- Strategic Importance:
  - Backbone of heavy industry
  - Long-term war sustainability
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Slower aircraft replacement
  - Reduced heavy weapon repair
  - Long recovery time if damaged

----------------------------------

1.3 Chemical Plants
- Produces explosives, propellants, gas agents, and fertilizers
- Strategic Importance:
  - Dual-use civilian and military production
  - Critical under blockade conditions
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Reduced bomb and shell output
  - Reduced gas warfare capability
  - Possible morale or political effects

==================================================
2. LOGISTICS & TRANSPORT TARGETS
(Closer to the front, high frequency, cascading effects)
==================================================

2.1 Rail Hubs & Marshalling Yards
- Move troops, aircraft, fuel, ammunition, and supplies
- Strategic Importance:
  - Primary arteries of the war
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Delays reinforcements
  - Slower resupply to airfields
  - Widespread operational penalties

----------------------------------

2.2 Supply Depots
- Store fuel, ammunition, food, and spare parts
- Strategic Importance:
  - Local sustainment nodes
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Temporary shortages
  - Reduced sortie rates
  - Faster recovery than factories, but frequent targets

----------------------------------

2.3 Ports & River Terminals
- Handle overseas and inland bulk transport
- Strategic Importance:
  - Critical for coal, raw materials, and imports
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Strategic bottlenecks
  - Especially impactful for maritime-dependent nations

==================================================
3. AIR & MILITARY SUPPORT TARGETS
(Directly tied to air power)
==================================================

3.1 Airfields
- Contain aircraft, pilots, fuel, and maintenance crews
- Strategic Importance:
  - Enables enemy air operations
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Reduced enemy sortie rate
  - Aircraft destroyed on the ground
  - Pilot casualties outside air combat

----------------------------------

3.2 Aircraft Factories & Engine Works
- Produce fighters, bombers, recon aircraft, and engines
- Strategic Importance:
  - Determines air superiority over time
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Slower aircraft replacement
  - Forced use of outdated models
  - Technology race pressure

----------------------------------

3.3 Training Fields & Schools
- Train pilots, observers, gunners, and mechanics
- Strategic Importance:
  - Pilot quality and survivability
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Lower skill replacements
  - Higher crash and loss rates
  - Direct interaction with Training systems

==================================================
4. COMMAND, INTELLIGENCE & MORALE TARGETS
(Soft targets with systemic effects)
==================================================

4.1 Headquarters & Command Centers
- Coordinate operations and planning
- Strategic Importance:
  - Centralized decision-making
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Slower enemy reactions
  - Poor coordination
  - Temporary chaos effects

----------------------------------

4.2 Communications Nodes
- Telegraph stations, signal towers, relay hubs
- Strategic Importance:
  - Information flow and responsiveness
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Delayed interceptions
  - Reduced coordination
  - Increased fog-of-war effects

----------------------------------

4.3 Civil / Morale Targets (Limited Use)
- Industrial towns, worker housing, power infrastructure
- Strategic Importance:
  - National morale and political pressure
- Gameplay Impact:
  - Morale shifts
  - Escalation consequences
  - Potential retaliation events

==================================================
DESIGN PRINCIPLES
==================================================

- All sides use the same target categories
- The player does not own most infrastructure
- Damage affects flow, not just output
- Air superiority shapes industrial survival
- The Western Front functions as a logistics web, not a factory zone
