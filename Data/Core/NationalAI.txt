WWI Pilot RPG — NationalAI.txt
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Defines how the Nation AI functions as a living war machine and how it evaluates, supports, and pressures the player.

============================================================
1) NATIONAL AI ROLE
============================================================

The Nation AI represents:
- High Command
- Industrial capacity
- Logistics networks
- Strategic planning
- Political pressure

The player does NOT control the Nation.
The player influences it.

The Nation:
- Plans the war
- Allocates resources
- Assigns priorities
- Judges performance
- Responds to success and failure

============================================================
2) NATIONAL AI TIME SCALE
============================================================

The Nation AI operates on MULTIPLE TIME SCALES:

- Daily: reacts to mission outcomes
- Weekly: adjusts allocations and priorities
- Monthly: shifts strategic focus
- Event-driven: responds to crises and opportunities

The player mostly feels DAILY and WEEKLY effects.

============================================================
3) NATIONAL STRATEGIC GOALS
============================================================

At any given time, the Nation AI maintains several weighted goals:

Examples:
- Gain air superiority in Sector X
- Support ground offensive
- Defend critical supply routes
- Suppress enemy bombing
- Train replacement pilots
- Preserve elite squadrons

Goals shift based on:
- Frontline situation
- Losses
- Political pressure
- Time period in the war

============================================================
4) PLAYER BASE EVALUATION
============================================================

Each player base is evaluated continuously using:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) PERFORMANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

- Mission success rates
- Loss ratios
- Mission difficulty
- Willingness to accept risk

------------------------------------------------------------
B) RELIABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------

- Ability to sustain operations
- Efficient resource use
- Low abort rates
- Stable logistics

------------------------------------------------------------
C) CAPABILITY
------------------------------------------------------------

- Base ratings (especially Transport, Maintenance, Operations)
- Aircraft types supported
- Training effectiveness

------------------------------------------------------------
D) STRATEGIC POSITION
------------------------------------------------------------

- Location relative to front
- Proximity to supply routes
- Vulnerability
- Strategic importance

============================================================
5) RESOURCE ALLOCATION
============================================================

The Nation allocates resources, not money.

Allocations include:
- Fuel
- Ammunition
- Spare parts
- Aircraft replacements
- Personnel
- Specialist staff

Allocation priority increases when:
- Performance is strong
- Base ratings support throughput
- Strategic goals align

Poor performance or inefficiency reduces priority.

============================================================
6) AIRCRAFT ALLOCATION
============================================================

Aircraft are scarce, especially advanced models.

The Nation decides:
- Which bases receive new aircraft
- How quickly replacements arrive
- Which bases get experimental or late-war types

Factors:
- Base capability
- Pilot quality
- Loss rates
- Strategic importance

Older aircraft remain in circulation longer at lower-priority bases.

============================================================
7) NATIONAL MISSION PLANNING
============================================================

The Nation AI plans missions independently of the player.

These include:
- Ground support
- Strategic bombing
- Recon operations
- Convoy protection
- Enemy suppression

The player may be:
- Assigned support missions
- Asked to coordinate
- Given optional objectives
- Temporarily subordinated to higher command

Refusing orders is allowed, but tracked.

============================================================
8) TROOP & STAFF ALLOCATION
============================================================

The Nation controls:
- Pilot assignments
- Instructor distribution
- Staff transfers
- Medical and logistics specialists

High-performing bases:
- Attract better personnel
- Retain veterans
- Receive reinforcements sooner

Low-performing bases may:
- Lose personnel
- Be stripped to reinforce others
- Be downgraded

============================================================
9) FACILITY & INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT
============================================================

The Nation also manages:
- Rail lines
- Depots
- Ports
- Rear-area airfields
- Training centers

Damage or overload in these systems:
- Reduces national throughput
- Affects all bases
- Can create cascading shortages

Player missions can:
- Protect national infrastructure
- Disrupt enemy logistics
- Relieve pressure elsewhere

============================================================
10) PRESSURE & CONSEQUENCES
============================================================

The Nation applies pressure through:
- Increased expectations
- Riskier missions
- Reduced margin for error
- Political oversight

Failure does not end the game immediately.
Instead, it creates:
- Reassignment
- Loss of priority
- Narrative consequences
- Strategic retreat

============================================================
11) TRANSPARENCY TO PLAYER
============================================================

The player is NEVER shown raw AI values.

Instead, feedback is delivered via:
- Command messages
- Allocation changes
- Mission availability
- Officer commentary
- News reports

The player should FEEL the Nation’s mood.

============================================================
12) DESIGN GOAL
============================================================

The Nation AI must feel:
- Rational
- Impersonal
- Sometimes unfair
- Ultimately understandable

It is not your enemy.
It is not your friend.
It is the war.

============================================================
