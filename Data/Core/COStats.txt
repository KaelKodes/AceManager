ACE MANAGER – COMMANDING OFFICER (CO) STAT SYSTEM
================================================

ROLE OVERVIEW
-------------
The Commanding Officer (CO) represents the player’s influence over the airbase.
The CO is not a combat unit and does not participate in missions directly.

The CO functions as a force multiplier through:
- Training and pilot development
- Morale and leadership
- Base logistics and efficiency
- Strategic and intelligence oversight

CO stats affect systems and outcomes, not raw pilot combat values.


STAT CATEGORIES
---------------

1. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT
2. COMMAND & MORALE
3. LOGISTICS & OPERATIONS
4. INTELLIGENCE & STRATEGY


------------------------------------------------
1. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT
------------------------------------------------

Training is conducted by:
- The CO
- One selected pilot acting as assistant trainer

CO stats directly influence training outcomes.

Training Skill
- Increases XP gained during training sessions
- Reduces risk of training failure or pilot injury
- Improves overall training efficiency

Instruction Focus
- Determines how targeted training can be
- Low values favor broad, safe stat improvements
- High values allow focused training on specific stats or roles
- High focus increases risk but improves results

Mentorship Synergy
- Governs how effectively the CO works with the assistant pilot
- High synergy improves training when the assistant pilot is skilled
- Low synergy causes diminishing returns from assistant contribution


------------------------------------------------
2. COMMAND & MORALE
------------------------------------------------

These stats affect pilots psychologically and socially.

Leadership
- Increases base-wide morale recovery
- Reduces morale loss from pilot injury, death, or mission failure
- Improves long-term pilot retention

Authority
- Determines how much strain pilots can endure
- Higher authority allows:
  - More intense training
  - Longer or riskier missions
- Low authority forces conservative operations

Reputation
- Represents how the CO is perceived externally
- Affects:
  - Quality of incoming pilots
  - Access to special opportunities or assets
  - Command tolerance for failures


------------------------------------------------
3. LOGISTICS & OPERATIONS
------------------------------------------------

These stats affect time, resources, and base throughput.

Operational Efficiency
- Reduces:
  - Repair time
  - Training cooldowns
  - Aircraft turnaround time
- Slightly improves fuel and supply usage

Resource Management
- Reduces waste from rushed repairs or emergency launches
- Improves effectiveness of limited resources
- Mitigates penalties during shortages

Base Organization
- Increases effective capacity of the base
- Enables:
  - More squads
  - More pilots
  - More simultaneous activities
- Acts as a soft cap modifier, not a hard unlock


------------------------------------------------
4. INTELLIGENCE & STRATEGY
------------------------------------------------

These stats influence information quality and long-term planning.

Tactical Insight
- Improves mission previews and forecasts
- Reduces unknown variables before sorties
- Helps pilots select better default tactics

Enemy Assessment
- Speeds identification of enemy roles and ace pilots
- Reduces surprise penalties in combat

Strategic Planning
- Improves long-term campaign outcomes
- Reduces chance of catastrophic failures
- Improves mission chain quality and pacing


------------------------------------------------
CO PROGRESSION
------------------------------------------------

CO stats improve through:
- Campaign milestones
- Major decisions
- Long-term success or failure trends

CO stats do NOT increase through direct mission grinding.

Progression is slow, meaningful, and capped by campaign phase.


DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------
- CO provides system-level influence, not raw combat bonuses
- No flat stat auras to pilots
- Emphasis on choice, risk, and long-term planning
- CO power comes from decisions, not micromanagement
