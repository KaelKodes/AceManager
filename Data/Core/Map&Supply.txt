WWI Pilot RPG — StrategicMapAndSupply.txt
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Defines how geography, supply routes, and infrastructure connect the Nation AI to player airbases.

============================================================
1) STRATEGIC MAP OVERVIEW
============================================================

The strategic map represents:
- Front lines
- National territory
- Supply infrastructure
- Airbases (player and AI-controlled)
- Key logistical connections

The map is NOT a tactical map.
It is an operational abstraction.

============================================================
2) MAP ELEMENT TYPES
============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
A) AIRBASES
------------------------------------------------------------

Airbases exist at fixed geographic locations.

Each airbase has:
- Coordinates
- Nation ownership
- Base ratings
- Supply connections
- Strategic importance value

Only ONE airbase is player-managed.
Others are AI-managed.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) SUPPLY NODES
------------------------------------------------------------

Supply nodes represent:
- Rail depots
- Ports
- Industrial centers
- Major logistics hubs

Supply nodes generate:
- Fuel
- Ammunition
- Spare parts
- Personnel throughput

Supply nodes do NOT belong to the player.

------------------------------------------------------------
C) CONNECTIONS (SUPPLY ROUTES)
------------------------------------------------------------

Connections link nodes and airbases.

Connection types:
- Rail
- Road
- River (optional, region-specific)
- Coastal sea lanes

Each connection has:
- Throughput capacity
- Distance
- Vulnerability
- Repair time if disrupted

============================================================
3) SUPPLY FLOW MODEL
============================================================

Supplies flow:
SUPPLY NODE → CONNECTION → AIRBASE

Flow is limited by:
- Connection throughput
- Distance
- Weather
- Enemy disruption
- Base Transport Access rating

No stock appears magically.

============================================================
4) CONNECTION TYPES
============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
A) RAIL
------------------------------------------------------------

- Highest throughput
- Fast delivery
- Highly vulnerable to bombing
- Long repair times

Rail is the backbone of sustained operations.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) ROAD
------------------------------------------------------------

- Moderate throughput
- Weather-sensitive
- More flexible
- Easier to repair

Roads keep bases alive when rail is damaged.

------------------------------------------------------------
C) RIVER / COASTAL
------------------------------------------------------------

- Region-dependent
- High volume
- Slow
- Requires ports or docks

Used mainly for fuel and bulk supplies.

============================================================
5) DISRUPTION & DAMAGE
============================================================

Connections can be disrupted by:
- Enemy bombing
- Sabotage
- Overuse
- Weather events
- Frontline movement

Disruption effects:
- Reduced throughput
- Delayed deliveries
- Increased losses in transit

Repairs take time and resources.

============================================================
6) PLAYER INTERACTION WITH THE MAP
============================================================

The player does NOT directly manage infrastructure.

However, the player can:
- Fly escort missions
- Suppress enemy airfields
- Conduct interdiction missions
- Protect convoys
- Scout enemy logistics

These actions influence:
- Supply safety
- National throughput
- Strategic pressure

============================================================
7) FRONTLINE MOVEMENT
============================================================

As ground fronts advance or retreat:
- New airbases become viable
- Others are abandoned
- Supply routes shift
- Strategic priorities change

The player may be ordered to:
- Relocate
- Expand forward
- Hold a vulnerable position
- Withdraw under pressure

============================================================
8) STRATEGIC CHOKE POINTS
============================================================

Some connections and nodes are designated as choke points.

Choke points:
- Carry disproportionate supply
- Are heavily contested
- Generate high-risk, high-reward missions

Losing a choke point affects many bases at once.

============================================================
9) NATIONAL AI USE OF THE MAP
============================================================

The Nation AI:
- Evaluates map control
- Adjusts supply routes
- Reassigns bases
- Shifts priorities based on pressure

The map is the AI’s primary planning surface.

============================================================
10) PLAYER FEEDBACK
============================================================

The player is informed of map effects through:
- Supply delays
- Mission availability changes
- Command briefings
- News reports
- Visual map indicators

Exact numbers are hidden.
Effects are felt, not calculated manually.

============================================================
11) DESIGN GOAL
============================================================

Geography must matter.

The player should learn:
- Why supplies are late
- Why missions increase or decrease
- Why a base suddenly struggles
- Why command attention shifts

The map is the silent hand behind every decision.
