WWI Pilot RPG — TimeAndMissions.txt
Version: 1.0
Status: CORE LOOP LOCKED
Purpose: Defines the daily time model, mission structure, and how missions consume resources and influence the wider war.

============================================================
1) TIME MODEL OVERVIEW
============================================================

The game operates on a DAILY CALENDAR.

- Time advances one day at a time.
- No continuous simulation.
- Nothing meaningful happens between days.
- All actions resolve as EVENTS on specific dates.

The player controls when to advance the day.

============================================================
2) DAILY STRUCTURE
============================================================

Each in-game day follows this sequence:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) DAY START
------------------------------------------------------------

The player is shown:
- Date (e.g. Feb 8, 1917)
- Location (current airbase)
- Weather
- Base status summary
- Scheduled events for the day

------------------------------------------------------------
B) PLAYER MANAGEMENT PHASE
------------------------------------------------------------

Before events resolve, the player may:

- Assign or cancel missions
- Select aircraft and pilots for missions
- Schedule training
- Adjust base investment priorities
- Reassign personnel
- Stand down squadrons to recover fatigue

No actions are hidden.
No time passes during this phase.

------------------------------------------------------------
C) EVENT RESOLUTION PHASE
------------------------------------------------------------

Scheduled events resolve, including:
- Missions flying and resolving
- Training completing
- Construction progress
- Supply arrivals or delays
- Recovery of wounded personnel
- Enemy actions (if triggered)

Results are presented clearly.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) END OF DAY
------------------------------------------------------------

The player confirms:
> “Advance to Next Day”

Only then does the calendar advance.

============================================================
3) MISSIONS AS PRIMARY EVENTS
============================================================

A mission is the primary “gameplay event” of the simulation.

Missions are:
- Planned intentionally
- Costly in resources
- Risky in personnel and aircraft
- Influential at the strategic level

You do NOT simulate patrols minute-by-minute.
You simulate outcomes.

============================================================
4) MISSION PLANNING PARAMETERS
============================================================

When creating a mission, the player selects:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) MISSION TYPE
------------------------------------------------------------

Common mission types:

- Local Patrol
- Interception
- Escort
- Reconnaissance
- Bombing
- Special / Historical

Each type defines:
- Expected duration
- Risk profile
- Strategic impact
- Resource intensity

------------------------------------------------------------
B) FORCE COMMITMENT
------------------------------------------------------------

The player chooses:
- Number of aircraft
- Which squadrons
- Which pilots

Larger forces:
- Increase success chance
- Increase resource cost
- Increase wear and fatigue
- Increase potential losses

------------------------------------------------------------
C) DISTANCE / TARGET
------------------------------------------------------------

Distance is measured from base to target.

Distance affects:
- Mission duration
- Fuel consumption
- Fatigue accumulation
- Abort probability

Distance is limited by:
- Aircraft distance_range
- Fuel availability
- Weather
- Runway rating

------------------------------------------------------------
D) RISK POSTURE (OPTIONAL, SIMPLE)
------------------------------------------------------------

Players may select:
- Conservative
- Standard
- Aggressive

This modifies:
- Engagement likelihood
- Loss probability
- Strategic impact

============================================================
5) REALISTIC MISSION DURATIONS
============================================================

Mission durations are abstracted, but historically grounded.

Typical ranges:

- Local Patrol: 30–60 minutes
- Interception: 45–90 minutes
- Escort: 1–2 hours
- Reconnaissance: 1–3 hours
- Bombing: 2–4 hours

Duration is not simulated directly.
It feeds into cost and fatigue calculations.

============================================================
6) RESOURCE COSTS PER MISSION
============================================================

Each mission consumes the following resources:

------------------------------------------------------------
A) FUEL
------------------------------------------------------------

Fuel cost scales with:
- Number of aircraft
- Distance
- Aircraft fuel_consumption
- Mission duration

Fuel shortages:
- Reduce mission options
- Force early aborts
- Increase accident risk

------------------------------------------------------------
B) AMMUNITION
------------------------------------------------------------

Ammo cost depends on:
- Mission type
- Engagement intensity
- Aircraft weapon systems

Bombing missions consume significantly more ammunition.

------------------------------------------------------------
C) MAINTENANCE WEAR (SPARE PART PRESSURE)
------------------------------------------------------------

Each sortie adds wear to aircraft.

Wear accumulates as:
- Maintenance stress
- Increased breakdown chance
- Longer repair times

High Maintenance rating reduces wear per sortie.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) PERSONNEL FATIGUE
------------------------------------------------------------

Pilots and crews accumulate fatigue based on:
- Mission duration
- Combat intensity
- Stress events

Fatigue:
- Reduces performance
- Increases accident risk
- Slows recovery if lodging is poor

============================================================
7) MISSION OUTCOMES
============================================================

Mission outcomes are determined by:
- Pilot stats and skills
- Aircraft capabilities
- Base ratings (Operations, Maintenance, Training)
- Enemy presence
- Weather
- Chosen risk posture

Possible outcomes include:
- Success
- Partial success
- Failure
- Losses
- Intelligence gained
- Strategic effects

============================================================
8) STRATEGIC FEEDBACK LOOP
============================================================

Mission results influence the wider war.

Positive effects over time:
- Improved air superiority
- Safer supply routes
- Ground offensive support
- Increased command confidence

These translate into:
- Increased resource allotments
- Higher aircraft priority
- Faster resupply
- Better replacement personnel
- Earlier access to advanced aircraft

You are rewarded with TRUST, not currency.

============================================================
9) HISTORICAL MISSIONS
============================================================

At certain dates and locations, historical missions may appear.

Characteristics:
- Optional, but noticed by command
- Higher risk
- Higher strategic impact
- Historically grounded objectives

Declining a mission is allowed.
Repeated refusal affects reputation.

============================================================
10) DESIGN GOAL
============================================================

The player should always understand:
- Why a mission succeeded or failed
- Why resources increased or decreased
- Why command views the base favorably or not

No invisible math.
No unexplained penalties.
