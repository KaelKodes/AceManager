WWI Pilot RPG — BaseRatings.txt
Version: 1.0
Status: STRUCTURE LOCKED
Purpose: Defines the base-level ratings that describe an airbase’s operational capability.
Scope: Applies to all player-managed airbases (Grass Strip → Forward Base → Regional Hub).

============================================================
1) CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE
============================================================

An airbase is defined by a set of RATINGS, not by individual buildings.

- Ratings range from Level I to Level V.
- Ratings improve through investment, time, and sustained operation.
- Ratings may advance unevenly.
- Higher ratings increase both capability and logistical pressure.
- Damage, overuse, or disruption can temporarily reduce effective rating.

Modules, facilities, and improvements exist to RAISE these ratings.

============================================================
2) BASE PROGRESSION CONTEXT
============================================================

Each base progresses through three archetypes:

- Grass Strip: Levels I – V
- Forward Base: Levels I – V
- Regional Hub: Levels I – V

A base must progress through all five levels of one archetype
before advancing to the next.

Ratings do not reset when advancing archetype, but their EFFECTS scale.

============================================================
3) BASE RATINGS (LEVEL I – V)
============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------
A) RUNWAY
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Surface quality
- Drainage
- Length and markings

Affects:
- Aircraft accident rate
- Aircraft weight/class limits
- Sortie reliability
- Weather sensitivity

Low levels restrict heavy aircraft and increase losses.
High levels enable safe, sustained operations.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) LODGING
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Living quarters
- Sanitation
- Heating and shelter

Affects:
- Personnel capacity
- Fatigue recovery
- Morale decay
- Attrition during bad weather

Overcrowding causes cascading fatigue and morale penalties.

------------------------------------------------------------
C) MAINTENANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Workshops
- Tools
- Skilled ground crews
- Spare part handling

Affects:
- Repair speed
- Aircraft downtime
- Spare part efficiency
- Chance of mechanical failure

Low maintenance ratings ground aircraft faster than combat losses.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) FUEL STORAGE
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- On-hand fuel capacity
- Storage safety
- Handling efficiency

Affects:
- Maximum fuel stock
- Sortie surge capability
- Vulnerability to supply delays
- Losses from bombing or accidents

Low fuel storage forces conservative operations.

------------------------------------------------------------
E) AMMUNITION STORAGE
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Ammunition stockpiles
- Bomb storage
- Handling safety

Affects:
- Mission availability (especially bombing)
- Sustained combat capability
- Risk of catastrophic loss

Low levels prioritize fighters over bombers.

------------------------------------------------------------
F) OPERATIONS / COMMAND
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Planning staff
- Intelligence integration
- Briefing quality
- Communications

Affects:
- Mission efficiency
- Loss mitigation
- Target selection
- Coordination bonuses

High operations ratings reduce randomness in outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------
G) MEDICAL
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- First aid capacity
- Surgical capability
- Recovery infrastructure

Affects:
- Injury recovery time
- Pilot survival rates
- Veteran retention
- Long-term manpower quality

Low medical ratings turn minor wounds into fatalities.

------------------------------------------------------------
H) TRANSPORT ACCESS
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Road quality
- Rail access
- Proximity to depots
- Local infrastructure

Affects:
- Supply throughput
- Resupply delays
- Allocation priority from command
- Strategic importance of the base

Transport access is the primary limiter on growth.

------------------------------------------------------------
I) TRAINING FACILITIES
------------------------------------------------------------

Represents:
- Formal and informal training processes
- Instructor pilots
- Drills and exercises
- Knowledge transfer

Affects:
- Pilot stat growth rate
- Rookie stabilization
- Skill acquisition chance
- Staff NPC effectiveness
- Replacement quality

Training raises the floor, not the ceiling.
Aces are still forged in combat.

============================================================
4) RATING STRESS & DEGRADATION
============================================================

Ratings can be temporarily reduced by:
- Overuse
- Supply shortages
- Enemy action
- Weather
- Personnel exhaustion

Stress effects stack and recover over time if pressure is relieved.

============================================================
5) STRATEGIC CONSEQUENCES
============================================================

The Nation evaluates a base based on its ratings:

- High Transport + Maintenance → more aircraft allocations
- High Training → better pilots and staff
- High Operations → sensitive missions assigned
- Poor Lodging or Medical → command concern

Your base competes implicitly with others for attention and resources.
