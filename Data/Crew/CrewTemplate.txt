WWI Pilot RPG — CrewTemplate.txt
Version: 1.0
Purpose: Defines all crew stats, skills, and formulas for pilots and support NPCs.

============================================================
1) CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
============================================================

All crew members (pilots, planners, logistics, maintenance, etc.) share
ONE unified stat system.

- Stats represent capability.
- Skills represent identity.
- Roles are defined by how stats are weighted, not by unique stats.
- No stat exists only for one role.
- Derived values drive simulation outcomes.

This system is inspired by ZenGM-style management sims:
- Many stats, not one power number
- Overall ratings are derived, not authoritative
- Team fit matters as much as individual excellence

============================================================
2) CORE CREW STATS (0–100 SCALE)
============================================================

All stats are integers from 0 to 100.
50 is average. The full scale is used.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) FLIGHT & ACTION (direct execution)
------------------------------------------------------------

CTL — Aircraft Control
- Precision flying
- Stall recovery
- Formation discipline
- Technical handling skill

GUN — Gunnery
- Accuracy
- Fire discipline
- Deflection shooting
- Weapon control

ENG — Energy Management
- Speed/altitude tradeoffs
- Boom-and-zoom competence
- Climb/dive judgment

RFX — Reaction
- Response speed to sudden threats
- Snap decisions
- Avoiding surprise attacks

------------------------------------------------------------
B) AWARENESS & COOPERATION (battlefield cognition)
------------------------------------------------------------

OA — Offensive Awareness
- Spotting enemies
- Identifying vulnerable targets
- Reading enemy intent
- Avoiding tunnel vision

DA — Defensive Awareness
- Detecting threats
- Recognizing pursuit
- Timely evasive action
- Warning allies

TA — Team Awareness
- Tracking ally positions
- Formation cohesion
- Understanding squad flow
- Awareness beyond self

WI — Wingman Instinct
- Willingness to assist allies
- Breaking off attacks to help
- Escort behavior
- Mutual protection priority

------------------------------------------------------------
C) DECISION & PSYCHOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------

AGG — Aggression
- Willingness to press attacks
- Risk tolerance
- Kill-seeking behavior

DIS — Discipline
- Doctrine adherence
- Patience
- Avoiding overcommitment

CMP — Composure
- Performance under fire
- Resistance to panic
- Stress management

ADP — Adaptability
- Responding to chaos
- Adjusting tactics mid-mission
- Learning in the field

------------------------------------------------------------
D) SQUAD & CAREER
------------------------------------------------------------

LDR — Leadership
- Morale influence
- Squad coordination
- Authority and trust

LRN — Learning Rate
- Speed of improvement
- Training effectiveness
- Skill acquisition

STA — Stamina
- Fatigue resistance
- Sortie endurance
- Sustained performance

============================================================
3) DERIVED RATINGS (NOT STORED)
============================================================

Derived ratings are calculated at runtime and used for mission resolution.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) Combat Role Ratings (Pilots)
------------------------------------------------------------

Dogfight Rating =
  0.25*CTL + 0.25*GUN + 0.20*OA + 0.15*RFX + 0.15*ENG

Energy Fighter Rating =
  0.30*ENG + 0.25*CTL + 0.20*OA + 0.15*DIS + 0.10*CMP

Ground Attack Rating =
  0.30*DIS + 0.25*GUN + 0.20*CTL + 0.15*CMP + 0.10*STA

Recon Survival Rating =
  0.35*DA + 0.25*OA + 0.20*ADP + 0.20*CMP

------------------------------------------------------------
B) Assist & Cooperation
------------------------------------------------------------

Assist Response Score =
  0.35*TA + 0.35*WI + 0.15*DA + 0.10*RFX + 0.05*LDR

Higher score increases probability of:
- Breaking off to assist
- Defending allies
- Creating 2v1 advantages

------------------------------------------------------------
C) Pair Cohesion (evaluated per sortie)
------------------------------------------------------------

Pair Cohesion =
  (TA₁ + TA₂)/2
+ (WI₁ + WI₂)/2
+ (DIS₁ + DIS₂)/2
- |AGG₁ - AGG₂| * 0.5

High cohesion improves survival and coordination.
Low cohesion increases isolation risk.

============================================================
4) KEY CREW SKILLS (IDENTITY TAGS)
============================================================

Skills are NOT stats.
They are derived flags shown to the player for fast comprehension.

------------------------------------------------------------
THE TEN LOCKED SKILLS
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Ace
- Elite air combatant
Derived from: High OA, GUN, ENG

2) Wingman
- Pair-focused protector
Derived from: High TA, WI, DA

3) Overwatch
- Squad-wide defensive awareness
Derived from: High DA, TA, CMP

4) Pack Hunter
- Excels in coordinated attacks
Derived from: High OA, TA, DIS

5) Lone Wolf
- Effective but uncooperative
Derived from: High OA, AGG AND low TA/WI

6) Steady
- Unshaken under fire
Derived from: High CMP, DA

7) Hotspur
- Aggressive, reckless attacker
Derived from: High AGG, RFX AND low DIS

8) Flight Leader
- Improves squad cohesion
Derived from: High LDR, TA

9) Instructor
- Accelerates training & development
Derived from: High LDR, DIS, LRN

10) Survivor
- Exceptional at disengagement & longevity
Derived from: High DA, ADP, CMP

============================================================
5) NON-PILOT NPC APPLICATION
============================================================

Non-pilot NPCs use the SAME stat system.
Stats are reinterpreted by role.

------------------------------------------------------------
Examples:
------------------------------------------------------------

Flight Planner:
- OA → Strategic Awareness
- DA → Risk Detection
- DIS → Mission Discipline
- ADP → Contingency Planning
- LDR → Coordination

Mission Planning Rating =
  0.35*OA + 0.25*DIS + 0.20*ADP + 0.20*LDR

Logistics Officer:
- DIS → Process Control
- ADP → Recovery
- STA → Workload Capacity
- LDR → Staff Output

Maintenance Chief:
- CTL → Technical Skill
- DIS → Quality Control
- ADP → Field Repairs
- LDR → Crew Efficiency

------------------------------------------------------------
Important:
------------------------------------------------------------

A planner will never have strong combat ratings,
just as a kicker will never lead a team in rushing yards.

But they can still be elite at their role.

============================================================
6) OVERALL & POTENTIAL (OPTIONAL SYSTEM)
============================================================

OVR (Overall Rating):
- Weighted average of role-relevant derived ratings
- Shown to player as an estimate

POT (Potential):
- Hidden ceiling
- Probability-based growth
- Aging reduces chance of reaching POT
