WWI Pilot RPG — PilotAdvancementAndRoles.txt
Version: 1.0
Status: CANONICAL (Single Source of Truth)
Purpose: Defines pilot stats, derived ratings, roles, skills, growth, fatigue, and rank advancement.
Scope: Applies to all pilots and (where noted) can extend to other crew types.

============================================================
1) PILOT STAT MODEL (0–100)
============================================================

All pilot stats are integers from 0 to 100.
50 is average. The full scale is used.

------------------------------------------------------------
A) FLIGHT & ACTION (execution)
------------------------------------------------------------

CTL — Control
- Stick-and-rudder skill; maneuvering and precision flight.
- Impacts: dogfight effectiveness, takeoff/landing safety, stable flying.

GUN — Gunnery
- Accuracy with machine guns and bombs; fire discipline.
- Impacts: kill chance, bombing accuracy, gunner effectiveness.

ENG — Energy Management
- Using altitude/speed advantages; climb/dive judgment.
- Impacts: energy fighting performance, disengage opportunities.

RFX — Reaction
- Response speed to sudden threats; snap decisions.
- Impacts: survival in close fights, gunner snap-shots.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) AWARENESS & COOPERATION (cognition)
------------------------------------------------------------

OA — Offensive Awareness
- Ability to spot enemies and identify openings.
- Impacts: engagement selection, intercept success, first-shot advantage.

DA — Defensive Awareness
- “Checking your six”; detecting pursuit and threats.
- Impacts: survival, recon/escort safety, ambush avoidance.

TA — Team Awareness
- Tracking ally positions and formation cohesion.
- Impacts: escort performance, coordinated attacks, flight stability.

WI — Wingman Instinct
- Protective behavior; willingness to assist and cover allies.
- Impacts: assist frequency, defensive saves, formation support.

------------------------------------------------------------
C) DECISION & PSYCHOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------

AGG — Aggression
- Willingness to push the attack (raises impact, increases risk).
- Impacts: engagement frequency, kill opportunities, overcommit chance.

DIS — Discipline
- Following orders; maintaining formation and restraint.
- Impacts: mission compliance, bomber/recon reliability, reduced mistakes.

CMP — Composure
- Performance under fire; resistance to panic and stress errors.
- Impacts: steady performance, reduced panic decay, survival.

ADP — Adaptability
- Handling failures, weather shifts, and chaos.
- Impacts: recon survival, recovery from bad situations, improvisation.

------------------------------------------------------------
D) CAREER & ENDURANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

LDR — Leadership
- Command trust and ability to direct others (no aura/buff by default).
- Impacts: eligibility for lead assignments; Nation AI trust weighting.

LRN — Learning Rate
- Multiplier for post-mission stat gains.
- Impacts: growth speed across all stats.

STA — Stamina
- Fatigue resistance; reduces degradation on long sorties.
- Impacts: endurance, fatigue accumulation, sustained ops.

============================================================
2) DERIVED RATINGS (USED BY SIM; NOT STORED)
============================================================

Derived ratings are calculated at runtime.

Dogfight Rating:
- Weighted combination of CTL, GUN, OA, RFX, ENG
- Used for: Patrol and Interception (fighter missions)

Energy Fighter Rating:
- Weighted combination of ENG, CTL, OA, DIS, CMP
- Used for: high-altitude/vertical combat situations

Ground Attack Rating:
- Weighted combination of DIS, GUN, CTL, CMP, STA
- Used for: Bombing and Strafing (anti-personnel)

Recon Survival Rating:
- Weighted combination of DA, OA, ADP, CMP
- Used for: Reconnaissance and long-range survival

OVR (Roster Display Only):
- (CTL + GUN + OA + DA + CMP) / 5
- A single, readable “at a glance” rating for UI.
- Not a guarantee of performance.

============================================================
3) SKILLS (PASSIVE TALENTS; UNLOCKED BY THRESHOLDS)
============================================================

Skills are identity tags. They do not replace stats.
Skills unlock when stat thresholds are met (example thresholds below).
Skills are shown to the player as badges.

(Initial three in current sim sheet)
- Ace:
  Requirement: OA, GUN, ENG > 70
  Effect: +3 effectiveness (flat) to air combat contribution

- Wingman:
  Requirement: TA, WI, DA > 70
  Effect: +1.5 effectiveness (flat) to flight contribution

- Steady:
  Requirement: CMP, DA > 70
  Effect: +1.0 effectiveness (flat) to flight contribution

Note:
- Additional skills may exist in the design bible (Overwatch, Pack Hunter, etc.)
- Implementations can extend this list, but skill philosophy stays consistent:
  Skills tilt probability; they never guarantee outcomes.

============================================================
4) PILOT GROWTH & ADVANCEMENT
============================================================

Pilots improve primarily through:
- Flying missions
- Surviving combat
- Training events (when scheduled)
- Victories (confirmed kills)

------------------------------------------------------------
A) POST-MISSION STAT GAINS
------------------------------------------------------------

After each mission:
- Relevant stats gain +0.1 to +1.0 (range depends on intensity and outcome)
- LRN multiplies these gains:
  Example: LRN 100 grows ~2× faster than LRN 50

Mission type influences what grows most:
- Patrol/Interception: CTL, GUN, OA, RFX, ENG
- Escort: TA, WI, DA, DIS, CMP
- Recon: DA, OA, ADP, CMP
- Bombing/Strafing: DIS, GUN, CTL, CMP, STA

------------------------------------------------------------
B) VICTORY BONUSES
------------------------------------------------------------

Each confirmed kill grants extra growth to:
- GUN
- OA
- CMP

(Exact bonus values tuned in balance pass.)

------------------------------------------------------------
C) DIMINISHING RETURNS (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent runaway late-game stats:
- Stats above 80 grow slower
- Stats above 90 grow much slower

(Exact scaling is tunable; principle is locked.)

============================================================
5) FATIGUE, INJURY, AND PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION
============================================================

Pilots accumulate fatigue based on:
- Mission duration
- Combat intensity
- Base Lodging rating
- STA (resistance)

Effects of high fatigue:
- Reduced effective performance (soft penalties)
- Increased accident risk
- Increased panic/stress incidents
- Slower recovery

Injury outcomes:
- Wounded: grounded for recovery (Medical rating affects time)
- KIA/MIA: removed from roster (narrative weight applied)

============================================================
6) RANK (PROMOTION) — DESCRIPTIVE, NOT BUFFING
============================================================

Rank is granted for accomplishments and trust.
Rank provides NO direct stat bonuses and NO auras.

Rank affects:
- Eligibility for certain responsibilities
- Nation AI assignment preferences (tie-breaks, trust)
- Narrative weight and consequences

------------------------------------------------------------
A) HIDDEN METRIC: MERIT (COMMAND TRUST)
------------------------------------------------------------

MERIT is a hidden value representing command trust.

MERIT increases from:
- Missions completed (difficulty-weighted)
- Mission success
- Survival under stress
- Following orders (DIS influence)
- Strategic importance of missions

MERIT increases slowly and is not player-visible.

------------------------------------------------------------
B) PROMOTION CHECKS
------------------------------------------------------------

Promotion checks occur periodically (weekly or monthly).
Command considers:
- MERIT threshold
- Missions flown minimum
- Current readiness (not wounded/grounded)
- Nation priorities and manpower needs

Rank ladder (example, nation-specific names can vary):
- Flight Sergeant (or equivalent)
- 2nd Lieutenant
- 1st Lieutenant
- Captain
- Major (rare)

Notes:
- Kills help, but do not guarantee promotion.
- Recon and escort veterans can rise without high kill counts.
- Promotion is a responsibility and may increase mission pressure.

============================================================
7) ROLE SYSTEM — DETECTED FROM STATS (NOT CHOSEN)
============================================================

Roles are inferred labels that describe what a pilot excels at.
Roles do not modify stats. They inform:
- UI presentation (baseball card style)
- Mission assignment suggestions
- Two-seater crew selection (critical)

Each pilot may have:
- Primary Role
- Secondary Role

Roles are re-evaluated:
- On creation
- Every X missions (recommended: every 5)
- After major injury
- After reassignment to different aircraft class/seat

------------------------------------------------------------
A) ROLE SCORING CONCEPT
------------------------------------------------------------

Each role has an internal RoleScore computed from:
- A key derived rating (where applicable)
- Supporting stats
- Optional usage bias (what missions/seat they actually flew)

RoleScore is internal and not shown to player.

Primary Role:
- Highest RoleScore above threshold

Secondary Role:
- Second-highest RoleScore if close to primary (recommended: within ~85–90%)

------------------------------------------------------------
B) ROLE DEFINITIONS (DETECTION RULES)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) Fighter
- Primary indicator: Dogfight Rating ≥ 70
- Supporting: OA ≥ 65, CTL ≥ 65, RFX ≥ 60, GUN ≥ 60
- Disqualifier: CMP < 45

2) Bomber Pilot
- Primary indicator: Ground Attack Rating ≥ 65
- Supporting: DIS ≥ 65, CMP ≥ 60, STA ≥ 60, CTL ≥ 55
- Disqualifier: AGG ≥ 75

3) Recon Pilot
- Primary indicator: Recon Survival Rating ≥ 65
- Supporting: DA ≥ 70, ADP ≥ 60, CMP ≥ 60
- Disqualifier: AGG ≥ 70

4) Gunner (Two-Seater Specialist)
- Primary indicator: GUN ≥ 70 and RFX ≥ 65
- Supporting: DA ≥ 60, CMP ≥ 55, STA ≥ 55
- Notes:
  - Intended for secondary-seat assignment
  - Usage bias can favor pilots with gunner seat history

5) Mentor
- Primary indicator: TA ≥ 70, DIS ≥ 65, CMP ≥ 65
- Supporting: LRN ≥ 60, WI ≥ 60
- Usage bias: flying with rookies; low panic incidents in mixed flights

6) Anti-Personnel
- Primary indicator: GUN ≥ 65 and AGG ≥ 70
- Supporting: RFX ≥ 60, CTL ≥ 55
- Disqualifier: DIS < 45

7) Rookie
- Default when:
  - Missions flown < 10, OR
  - No RoleScore meets threshold
- Notes:
  - High LRN accelerates role emergence
  - Rookie is expected to disappear over time

============================================================
8) TWO-SEATER CREW ASSIGNMENT (PILOT + SECONDARY)
============================================================

Two-seater aircraft require:
- Pilot seat
- Secondary seat (gunner/observer)

Seat contribution is evaluated separately.

General guidance:
- Pilot seat favors: CTL, DA, ADP, CMP (plus mission-specific stats)
- Secondary seat favors: GUN, RFX, DA, CMP, STA

Role fit becomes strategically important:
- Recon Pilot + Gunner pairing is ideal for recon aircraft
- Bomber Pilot + Gunner pairing is ideal for bombing two-seaters

Poor pairing is allowed but increases:
- losses
- aborts
- mission volatility

============================================================
9) UI PRESENTATION (BASEBALL CARD GOAL)
============================================================

Pilot cards should show:
- Name, nation, unit
- OVR and POT (if used)
- Fatigue/Status
- Primary and Secondary Role
- Key skills (badges)
- Career stats (sorties, victories, wounds, etc.)

The UI should not show raw RoleScore or MERIT.
It should explain outcomes through plain-language callouts.
